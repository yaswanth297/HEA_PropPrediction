High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) represent a novel class of materials composed of multiple elements in roughly equiatomic proportions, exhibiting exceptional mechanical and physical properties. This project focuses on harnessing machine learning techniques to predict the bulk modulus of HEAs, which is crucial for understanding their mechanical behavior and facilitating their application in various engineering domains.
In this study, we employ a machine learning approach to predict the bulk modulus of HEAs comprising 4 to 6 elements. A classifier is first utilized to identify whether a given HEA composition exists within the dataset, leveraging the distinctive characteristics of HEAs. Subsequently, an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression model is employed to predict the bulk modulus for identified HEA compositions.
The dataset utilized for model training and evaluation encompasses a diverse range of HEA compositions along with their corresponding bulk moduli, sourced from experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Feature engineering techniques tailored to HEAs are applied to extract relevant features from the elemental compositions.The performance of the developed model is assessed using various metrics, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared. Additionally, the model's robustness is evaluated through cross-validation and sensitivity analysis.
The proposed machine learning framework not only streamlines the prediction process but also provides insights into the complex relationships between alloy composition and bulk modulus in HEAs. This predictive model can serve as a valuable tool for materials scientists and engineers in the design and optimization of HEAs with tailored mechanical properties, thereby accelerating the development of advanced materials in engineering applications.
