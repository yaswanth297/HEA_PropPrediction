# Predicting Bulk Modulus of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) Using Machine Learning

## Overview

High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a groundbreaking class of materials composed of multiple elements in roughly equiatomic proportions, known for their outstanding mechanical and physical properties. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the bulk modulus of HEAs, a key parameter for understanding their mechanical behavior and optimizing their use in various engineering applications.

## Project Objectives

- **HEA Classification**: Utilize a classifier to determine whether a given HEA composition exists within our dataset, based on its unique characteristics.
- **Bulk Modulus Prediction**: Apply an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression model to predict the bulk modulus of identified HEA compositions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the models includes a wide range of HEA compositions and their corresponding bulk moduli, sourced from both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. 

## Results

The proposed machine learning framework streamlines the prediction process and provides valuable insights into the relationships between alloy composition and bulk modulus in HEAs. This predictive model serves as a tool for materials scientists and engineers, aiding in the design and optimization of HEAs with tailored mechanical properties. It accelerates the development of advanced materials for engineering applications.

## Usage

The model can be employed to predict bulk modulus values for various HEA compositions, facilitating material design and optimization tasks. Detailed instructions for usage, including data preparation and model training, are provided in the project documentation.
